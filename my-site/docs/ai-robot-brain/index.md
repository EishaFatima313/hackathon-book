# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Welcome to the AI-Robot Brain!

Welcome to Module 3 of our Robotics Education Platform! In this module, you'll explore the cutting-edge world of AI-powered robotics using NVIDIA Isaac technology. This module focuses on advanced perception and navigation, teaching you how to create intelligent robots that can see, understand, and navigate through complex environments.

## What You'll Learn

This module delves into advanced robotics AI using NVIDIA's powerful Isaac platform:
- **Isaac Sim**: Creating photorealistic simulations and synthetic data
- **Isaac ROS**: Hardware-accelerated perception pipelines
- **Nav2**: Advanced navigation for humanoid robots

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
- Generate synthetic datasets using Isaac Sim for AI training
- Implement perception pipelines with Isaac ROS
- Configure Navigation2 for humanoid robot path planning
- Integrate AI perception with navigation systems

## Target Audience

This module is designed for intermediate AI and robotics students who have completed the basics of ROS2 and robot simulation. We'll build on your existing knowledge to tackle more advanced concepts in robotics AI.

## Module Structure

The module is divided into three comprehensive chapters:

### Chapter 1: Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data
Learn how to use NVIDIA Isaac Sim to create photorealistic environments and generate synthetic data for training AI models. Discover how synthetic data can accelerate robotics development while reducing costs and risks.

### Chapter 2: Isaac ROS (VSLAM & Perception)
Explore Isaac ROS packages that provide hardware-accelerated perception capabilities. Learn about Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and how to build perception pipelines that enable robots to understand their environment.

### Chapter 3: Nav2 for Humanoid Path Planning
Master Navigation2, ROS2's official navigation framework, and learn how to adapt it for humanoid robots. Understand the unique challenges of bipedal navigation and how to overcome them.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Solid understanding of ROS2 concepts
