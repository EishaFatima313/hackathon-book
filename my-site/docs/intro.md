## Course Modules

The course is organized into three main chapters:

### 1. [ROS 2 Basics](./ros2-basics/ros2-intro.md)
- Introduction to ROS 2 concepts (nodes, topics, services, messages)
- ROS 2 architecture overview
- Simple rclpy examples

### 2. [AI Agents → Robot Control](./ai-robot-control/ai-robot-bridge.md)
- Using rclpy to publish/subscribe to ROS topics
- Bridging Python AI agents to ROS controllers
- Example implementations of command interpretation

### 3. [Humanoid Structure with URDF](./humanoid-urdf/humanoid-structure.md)
- Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Creating humanoid robot models
- Visualization techniques using RViz and Gazebo

## Getting Started

Start with the [ROS 2 Basics](./ros2-basics/ros2-intro.md) chapter to learn fundamental concepts, then progress through the modules to understand how AI agents can control humanoid robots.
